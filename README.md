# DS-CPUSpeedCheck
Checks the DS(i)/3DS console for NTR or TWL Clock speed

The check works without access to SCFG, by increasing a value each cycle within one frame.

If you're on DSi or 3DS running in DSi mode, then the TWL speed bit in SCFG is checked.     
You can run the SCFG-less method of checking, by holding L to lock access to SCFG, immediately after launching this app.
